“My enthusiasm.”--
I am pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science and I live in Jersey City, New
Jersey. I have an immense passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics,
Predictive Modeling, Deep Learning, Quantitative Analysis et cetra.

“The past and the present.”--
I Completed Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Amity
University, India. I found the area of Artificial Intelligence the most intriguing and
interesting. At Stevens Institute of Technology, I have gained profound insights into
various computer science topics as well as business intelligence and analytics. I use
technology such as R, Python, SAS, SQL, Excel et cetra. I have been learning the use
of Hadoop, MapReduce, MongoDB in the industry also. Lately I have been working on
understanding Cognitive Computing and the use of TensorFlow and IBM Watson Analytics.
Apart from my curriculum I am developing my skills on Inferential Statistics. Being
the Treasurer of the Society of Computer Science (SOCS) at Stevens has shaped my
managerial abilities.

“Internships – professional experience.”--
I have two internship experience where I worked on different projects and areas such
as SQL, Tableau and Python. Then I learnt the impact that “Big Data” could have in
future and more importantly how we could use that jargon to reshape the world,
optimize the resources available for future, making correct predictions, make people
watch and hear that they want to et cetra. One of the most important thing I realized
after doing that internship was that I was so engaged in understanding the concepts of
Data Science, so I thought of making this field as my career.

“The future.”--
I want to use relevant technologies to contribute back and make things happen. I want
to have opportunities to develop my skills and learn new ones but not limited to just
technical. I want to be a part of strong team working toward a clear vision that I can
be passionate about. I want to learn new things each and every day and make sure that
everything I learn; I am able to use that technology in a constructive way.

“My thought process.”--
I think, Life is not about the challenges we come across, but how we fight them. I
logically analyze situations and mold solutions that are practical and cater well to
my needs. There's a thing to move on crossing over whatever comes our way, but par
ordinary is the attitude to chalk every situation as an achievement in one's lifetime
leaving behind a legacy. And I choose to belong to the latter, a quality that filters
me out from the general.
